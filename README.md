Here is a **fully-fledged `README.md`** for your **Feature Pipeline** project, complete with setup instructions, project overview, usage, and key learnings:

```markdown
# 🧠 Feature Pipeline for Tabular Data Preprocessing

A modular and production-ready feature engineering pipeline using `scikit-learn` and `feature-engine`. This project prepares raw tabular data for machine learning by handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and ensuring pipeline reusability.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Modular pipeline using `scikit-learn.Pipeline`
- ✅ Handles missing values (numerical & categorical)
- ✅ One-hot encoding of categorical variables
- ✅ Saves the pipeline for reuse or deployment
- ✅ Clean architecture with separation of logic

---

## 🛠️ Setup & Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/feature-pipeline.git
cd feature-pipeline
````

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)**

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install Dependencies**

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🧪 Sample Dataset

* Expected format: A `.csv` file containing both numerical and categorical columns
* Place your file in `data/dataset.csv`

---

## 🧰 Usage

### ▶️ Run the pipeline

```bash
python main.py
```

### 💾 Output

* Transformed data preview in console
* Preprocessing pipeline saved as `pipeline.joblib`

---

## 🧩 Core Components

### 🔧 `transformer.py`

Builds the pipeline with:

* `CategoricalImputer`: replaces missing categorical values with most frequent
* `MeanMedianImputer`: replaces missing numerical values with mean
* `OneHotEncoder`: encodes categorical columns into binary format

### 💾 `pipeline_feature.py`

* `save_pipeline()`: Saves the pipeline using `joblib`

### 🧠 `main.py`

* Loads the data
* Builds, fits, and transforms using the pipeline
* Saves the trained pipeline

---

## 📚 Key Learnings

* 📦 **Modular Pipelines**: Cleaner code and reusable preprocessing logic
* 🔍 **Missing Value Strategy**: Essential before any transformation or modeling
* 🎯 **Feature Consistency**: Transforms used in training must be reused in production
* 📁 **Organized Structure**: Easier debugging, testing, and scalability
* 💡 **Custom Transformers**: Easily pluggable for future enhancement

---

## 🧼 To-Do / Enhancements

* [ ] Add scaling (e.g., `StandardScaler`) for numerical features
* [ ] Column type auto-detection
* [ ] CLI or Streamlit UI for pipeline building
* [ ] Unit testing for transformer steps
